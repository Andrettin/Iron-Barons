He established an alliance with the Habsburg king Albert II, who made Ulrich for a short while his lieutenant in Bohemia. After Albert's death in 1439, Ulrich presided at the coronation of his infant son Ladislaus V Posthumus in 1440. Count Ulrich was able to lead a successful crusade, nominally in the Habsburg interest, into Hungary in 1450. In 1452 he forced the emperor Frederick III to hand over the boy king Ladislaus V to his keeping, and became thus practically ruler of Hungary."
