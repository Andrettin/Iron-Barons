	description = "Count of Cilli, his influence in the troubled affairs of Hungary and the Empire early overshadowed that of his father, Frederick II. He established an alliance with the Habsburg king Albert II, who made Ulrich for a short while his lieutenant in Bohemia. After Albert's death in 1439, Ulrich presided at the coronation of his infant son Ladislaus V Posthumus in 1440. Count Ulrich was able to lead a successful crusade, nominally in the Habsburg interest, into Hungary in 1450. In 1452 he forced the emperor Frederick III to hand over the boy king Ladislaus V to his keeping, and became thus practically ruler of Hungary."
