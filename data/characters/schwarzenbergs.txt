	description = "The best-known representative of the Schwarzenberg princely family, and an important Austrian statesman. On Nov. 21st of 1848 he was appointed head of a reactionary ministry. On March 7th 1849 a centralized constitution for the whole Austrian monarchy was proclaimed. His refusal to incorporate only the German provinces of the monarchy in the proposed new German Empire had thrown the German parliament into the arms of Prussia. His success in restoring the status quo ante of the German Confederation, with the old predominance of Austria, was largely due to his diplomatic skill, unscrupulousness and iron tenacity of purpose."
